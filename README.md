## Description

A webpage whose underlying HTML and CSS code has been refactored in order to make it more accessible.

Improving a website's accessibility helps to ensure people with disabilities can access it using assistive technologies, as well as making it better positioned in search engines.

In recfactoring the source code, I improved my understanding of Semantic HTML elements and how they can be used to help organise webpages, and I also gained practice with targetting specific elements using CSS rules.
